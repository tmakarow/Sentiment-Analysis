# Sentiment-Analysis
Python Twitter Sentiment Analysis

I started this assignment by creating the keywords dictionary. I prompted the user for the keywords file and read through it. I split each line at the comma to create two separate elements. Index 0 was the key and the element at index 1 was the value. Then I closed the file. I then created my ProcessTweets function, which calculates the value of all the sentiment keywords found in the tweet. It checks to see if word in tweet is a sentinel keyword and calculates total value of sentiment keywords in tweet. The function returns happyscore which is the total value of sentiment keywords in tweet. I then created variables, set values for number of tweets, the total sentiment value for each timezone. I then prompted the user for the tweets file and opened and read that. I processed the file to find the latitude and longitude of each tweet and used if statements to file each tweet in its timezone. In each set of nested if statements, I used the processTweets function to find the happiness value and then calculated the number of tweets for each timezone. I then closed the tweets file. Then, I calculated average "happiness" value for each timezone. Then I printed the "happiness" score and number of tweets for each timezone. Finally, I imported the happy_histogram program and used it to create a graphical representation of my data.
